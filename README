There is a new schema file to deal with not being able to store the decimal values correctly with the old schema. It still needs work to reduce some wasted storage.

igc2obj.pl prints out the faction related information of an IGC file.

igc2mysql.pl will read in the faction information from an IGC file via pICE and write the results to a mySQL database. You need to set up the database user/and password by editing the file.
